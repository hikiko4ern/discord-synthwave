# Discord SynthWave

This is a SynthWave theme for Discord's code blocks, based on [SynthWave '84 for VS Code][original-theme] by [Robb Owen].

## Installation

For [BetterDiscord] (ex Bandaged BetterDiscord) download [this file][bd-theme] and put the file in your themes folder.

If you use [EnhancedDiscord], put the contents of [this file][ed-theme] after another imports in your CSS Loader's style file.

> ⚠️ since EnhancedDiscord is no longer supported, the functionality of the theme for it is not guaranteed
